# Tkinter_Project
    This project is a simulation of a school student data management application.

# Software requirements:
    - MySQL
    - Python (at least version 3.10)
# Packages used for Python:
    - tkinter
    - mysql.connector
    - webbrowser
    - os
    - PIL
    - subprocess
    - re
    - datetime
    - io
# Be carful:
    Add the following two paths to the PATH environment variable in the system variables, in order to allow the correct execution of the "School.exe" files:

    C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Shell 8.0\bin
    C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin

    I also recommend being careful when entering information related to the database in the command (cmd). If you make a mistake when entering, please modify the "var" variable by giving it the value 0 (var=0) in the "config.properties" file, then save and try again.

    If you encounter any problems, please do not hesitate to contact us by email.

    Best regards.
